# Hackday Netflix Search App

This React app uses the Github search API to bring you a clean, simple way to search through any Git repository and see important information about the commit messages.  It features:

- [A deployed page for easy access](https://frontend-intern-hackday-rbd0qo8o2-kanderson58.vercel.app/)
- 100% accessibility with a perfect Lighthouse report and ability to use without a mouse
- Error handling and a loading state (with animation!) so the user is not left wondering what might be happening behind the scenes
- Readable, clean design that makes it simple to scroll through and navigate pages

Future iterations of this app will:
- Use React Router in place of conditional rendering to seamlessly navigate from page to page
- Add additional styling for an even more attractive UI
- Fully lint the final product
- Incorporate propTypes or convert to Typescript for type verification
